# Spotify Playlist -> Apple Playlist 
This is a Python script that converts Spotify playlists to Apple Music playlists using the Spotify and Apple Music APIs. With this script, you can easily transfer your favorite Spotify playlists to Apple Music without having to manually search for each track.

# How it Works
The script uses the Spotify API to get the list of tracks from the Spotify playlist, and then uses a music metadata API to get the Apple Music ID for each track. It then creates a new Apple Music playlist and adds the tracks to it.

# Getting Started
To use this script, you will need to have Spotify and Apple Music API credentials, and an Apple Music user token. You will also need to install the requests library using pip.

Once you have all the necessary credentials and libraries, you can run the script by entering the Spotify playlist URL and the name of the new Apple Music playlist in the script. The script will then convert the Spotify playlist and create the new Apple Music playlist.

# How to Run the Script
To run the script, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the requests library by running pip install requests in your terminal.
3. Open spotify_to_apple.py in your preferred text editor.
4. Fill in the necessary credentials and playlist information in the script (e.g. Spotify client ID and secret, Apple Music developer token, Spotify playlist URL, and Apple Music playlist name).
5. Save the changes to the script.
6. In your terminal, navigate to the directory containing the script.
7. Run the script by typing python spotify_to_apple.py in your terminal and pressing enter.
The script will then convert the Spotify playlist and create the new Apple Music playlist.

The script will then convert the Spotify playlist and create the new Apple Music playlist.
