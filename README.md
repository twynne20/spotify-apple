# spotify-apple
This is a Python script that converts Spotify playlists to Apple Music playlists using the Spotify and Apple Music APIs. With this script, you can easily transfer your favorite Spotify playlists to Apple Music without having to manually search for each track.

# How it Works
The script uses the Spotify API to get the list of tracks from the Spotify playlist, and then uses a music metadata API to get the Apple Music ID for each track. It then creates a new Apple Music playlist and adds the tracks to it.

# Getting Started
To use this script, you will need to have Spotify and Apple Music API credentials, and an Apple Music user token. You will also need to install the requests library using pip.

Once you have all the necessary credentials and libraries, you can run the script by entering the Spotify playlist URL and the name of the new Apple Music playlist in the script. The script will then convert the Spotify playlist and create the new Apple Music playlist.
